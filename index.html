        <h1>Lift Off</h1> As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in
        size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living
        object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would fall apart. Seeing this has
        to change a man.

        <h1>Can We Visit Planets?</h1> Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world
        as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually
        meet. which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals.

        <h1>Let's Go For A Walk</h1> The Earth was small, light blue, and so touchingly alone, our home that must be defended like
        a holy relic. The Earth was absolutely round. It suddenly struck me that that tiny pea, pretty and blue, was the
        Earth. I put up my thumb and shut one eye, and my thumb blotted out the planet Earth.
