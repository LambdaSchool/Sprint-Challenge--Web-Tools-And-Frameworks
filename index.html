                <h3>Hello,</h3>
                <p class="h3">While you may not know it, you have entered a random stream of consciousness of another person's psyche.
                  Namely mine. The reason for this digression is mainly because I want to test the capabilities of the scroll
                  function of this modal and didn't want to just copy paste some random text and deal with the potential
                  of plagiarism. So I'm afraid that you're stuck with me in a way. I'm currently trying to learn Bootstrap
                  in my computer science immersive bootcamp program. There are days that I feel like I'm a fish out of water
                  and that I will never understand everything that's going on and other days where I feel the opposite. On
                  days that I understand what's going on, I try really hard to share that knowledge with other people because
                  I have always been a firm believer in the theory that it is best to teach a concept that you know in order
                  to better understand how well you know the concept. It's the only reason I'm still jacked in to the Lambda
                  Prep Slack - to occasionally help out and try to explain concepts in a way that people that don't know
                  anything about JavaScript may still understand. I wonder if this has been long enough to test the scrolling
                  capabilities of this bar. What exactly is considered legal to copy without repercussion? My cats have settled
                  down for a while, which is nice. They've tried.... I say they, but I really mean Robert Lazarus (Bobcat)
                  ... to eat my class notes again today. I guess that's what I get for being a paper and pen kind of person.
                  It's not that I find it any faster - I'm a touch typist and used to type for a living so I'm actually faster
                  than a lot of people - but it gets in the way of my ability to think. Something about typing just gets
                  me focused on what I'm putting on the page without actually paying attention to what's going onto the page,
                  so if anything it hinders my learning. I don't know why I'm talking about all this on a modal for a page
                  about the moon, but I'm running on the assumption that no one's really going to read this so it's more
                  for my own amusement than anything else. I was tempted to use a poem instead... and I might just. In fact,
                  here you go, one of my favorites.</p>
