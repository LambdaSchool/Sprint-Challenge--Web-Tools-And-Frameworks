1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
To me, preprocessing is like ES6. It is syntactical sugar. All the code written in less and bootstrap gets compiled down to plain css. I would explain that these tools exist to make the programmer's life easier, but that, at the end of the day the computer reads it all the same.
2. What is the yarn command to globally install LESS?
brew install yarn
3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
I really like the box shadow mixin. I think it's simple, but makes for a much better impression on the user.
4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?
xs, sm, md, lg, xl.
5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?
d-flex.
