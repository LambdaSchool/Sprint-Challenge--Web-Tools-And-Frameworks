1. I honestly think you guys are doing it the right way, introduce CSS so first, so that when we hit preprocessors,
we know what the preprocessors are actually doing. When I used to dabble in Rails, I would use preprocessors (SASS)

the way you teach it.
2. yarn global add less
3. A center mixin I took from Josh. I used it up until bootstraps versions of align and justify, but I was using that
center mixin quite a bit. A padding and margin mixin to keep things looking uniform was useful too.

5. d-flex
