1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
If I were to explain the basic idea preprocessing to a friend, I would say preprocessing is like putting change into a coinstar machine. At first you have all these coins that are unorganized, and you may not even know how much money you have in your change container. After putting them into the coinstar machine, you are given your money back in the form of paper and any leftover change. The point is that preprocessing improves the organization and efficiency of the code.
