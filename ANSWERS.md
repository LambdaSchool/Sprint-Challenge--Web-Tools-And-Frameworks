1.  How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

Preprocessing is a little like a court stenographer. People's natural speach (i.e. the raw CSS) is actually pretty unwieldy. Even if typing it out verbatim in real time were possible
it wouldn't be desireable. Once you get used to it, the machined shorthand is both easier to write and to reference.

(xl) >= 1200px
