1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

Preprocessing is CSS with features that you wish CSS implemented. Preprocessors have the ability to make you write less code to have the same styling on the webpage. Also if there is a color that you want to implement in multiple spots then there is a way to store that color value into a variable. Math can be used inside the CSS so if you change the main container width then there would be no effect on the responsiveness because the calculations for margin and padding will adjust.
