1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

  To teach the ideas of preprocessing to someone who understands programming on a basic level, I would liken it to a styling graphing calculator. When you're using the basic version of a calculator, as with CSS, you have to manually work out each part of an equation. With a graphing calculator, there is a system behind the interface that performs complicated calculations needed for larger-scale problems. Using a preprocessor feels much the same to me. (bootstrap as well)
