1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
I would explain it as a program that essentially allows you to write shorthand css, then translates it into css the html
can understand. From there I could talk about variables and mixins, and explain how powerful a preprocessor is, but that first
bit gets the idea across.

2. What is the yarn command to globally install LESS?
I honestly forget, and would have to use a search engine for anything regarding yarn.

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
None of the provided mixins are useful, so I won't act like they are. All of the provided mixins deal with single
lines of code, and we haven't built a series of wbsites where copying the same styles is useful yet. As far as I'm concerned,
for these smaller projects, mixins are a waste of time, though something we'll need to know how to use.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?
xs, sm, md, lg, xl



5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?
d-flex
