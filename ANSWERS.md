1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
    First I think he needs to understand the difference between a full language and CSS, if he already had some basic programming knowledge, I would explain that all preprocssing is is creating your own custom variables and calling them inside the CSS file. I would show how the same thing works for classes, and nesting. I think eventually you would have to show him the documentation and let him go at it himself.
