1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
		Preprocessing is basically an advanced feature of the css.  How I understand it is that you are now able to use variables, functions, mixing (to name a few) to write specific css styles, Name it (give it a class name).  And then use that “class name” throughout your css style sheet over and over again without having to write out all the same css style.  You can use a compiler like LESS or SASS to help covert the variables, functions, mixin back to regular css styles that CSS can recognize it and can output.
