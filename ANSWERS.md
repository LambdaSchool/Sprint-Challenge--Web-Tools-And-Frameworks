1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

    If they had a basic understanding of css, I would say that it's like a programming language for css. It adds new
  features to make it easier to write and style with, that then get's refactored into base css using a compiler.

    If they didn't know css, I'd say css is how a webpage is made to look better, and that a preprocessor extends the
  ease of use for css.
