1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
specifically,
.new-button (@width, @height, @background) {
	width: @width;
	height: @height;
	background: @background;

But the reason I chose that is more general. Creating a mixin with multiple variables that you know you will use many times (often in many different projects) is very powerful and much mor efficient.
