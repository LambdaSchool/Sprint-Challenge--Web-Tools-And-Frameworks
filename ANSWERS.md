1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

I would explain that preprocessing allows us to make use of programming tools like and abstraction and functions to set up more general rules about how css should be implemented on the page, then the preprocessor interprets those rules and converts them to plain CSS. This allows us to use variables, and have nesting structures that are more expressive and less repetitive than the standard CSS approach. We can also build classes up on each other using mix-ins, and create parametric mix-ins with default values, which allows for a high level of customizability while also allowing us to quickly plug in attributes to classes where no customization is need.
