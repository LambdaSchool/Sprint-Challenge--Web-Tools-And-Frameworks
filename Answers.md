1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? 
Preprocessors provide you extra funtionality to use in your project such as mixins, variables, functions etc, and it helps streamline how you create and manage the files in CSS. Basically it allows you to define the properties (just one time) that you are going to use and then it will reuse them throughout your entire project! This is way easier than having to write your own CSS from scratch! A few different preprocessing programs exist, but the one we were taught and that I find user friendly is LESS.
