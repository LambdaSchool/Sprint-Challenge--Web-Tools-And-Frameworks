1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

I would first show my friend how to get everything set up on their computer because it is important that he/she follow along and begin typing commands as well as Less syntax on their own computer while they are being taught the basics of preprocessing. Afterwards, I will go over some basic CSS and then teach my friend how we can use a language extension called Less to making typing CSS feasible.

  background: white;
