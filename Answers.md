Question 1: I would explain the basic idea of preprocessors by explaining the design limitations of CSS. Then I would explain that preprocessors can get around those limitations by adding the desired styles and designs and then converting those codes to CSS. 
Question 2: npm install -g less
Question 3: Still grasping onto the idea of using preprocessors, especially since I'm still not confident in my CSS skills. I have used the skew mixin successfully though. 
Question 4: xs, sm, md, and xl. 
Question 5: display.
