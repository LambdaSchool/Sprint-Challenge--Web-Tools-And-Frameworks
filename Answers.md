1. A CSS preprocessor is CSS with a few added perks. Not only can you write your standard CSS, but you can define reusable variables, mixins (custom css style functions), mathematical functions and more. Also, you have the ability to nest your syntax making for easier to read code that flows inline with your HTML. Then you can split each group of similiar css (reset, header, main-content, footer, etc...) into its own file and then have them all imported to a singular file which is then complied to standard CSS.
