1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy 	and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

	I first explain that preprocessing is a web tool that allows developers to write
	more efficient and readable CSS and explain the general headaches of using only normal
	CSS. For example, in normal CSS, selector chains can become difficult to manage because
	specificity can be ambiguous. Luckily preprocessing allows us to nest selectors so they mirror the structure of our html files.

	I would then help my friend install a preprocessor and teach them the basics with simple examples using the docs. After going over some basic concepts, I would have my friend work on some small projects using preprocessors.

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?

	The global command is npm install -g less. Node must first be installed before using this command. Also the command sudo might have to be used if the user does not have admin status.

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?

	I liked using button mixins since buttons can use a fair amount of CSS styles.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?

	The 5 breakpoints are: xs, sm, md, lg, xl
	
5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?

	d-flex is the utility used to turn an element into a flex container.
