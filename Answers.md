# Sprint Challenge: Web Tools and Frameworks

## Self Study Questions:

1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
    *  Preprocessing is the latest upgrade to the world of styling web site elements.  It is really great because it comes with a plethora of additional functionallity that was not previously available in regular CSS.  Some of these new features include Variables, Functions, Operators, Mixins etc.  

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?
    *  npm install less

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
    *  Hard to say after being exposed to Bootstrap 4, but perhaps opacity as it is very useful for hovers, although I later found out that you can also just divide the color by 1.5.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?
    * xs sm md lg xl

5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?
    * d-flex
