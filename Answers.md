1. A preprocessor is a tool that has some defaults to help make laying out a design quick. It keeps you from writing as much code but still getting the same effect. Further, the preprocessor defaults can be customized, which makes it easy to 'slap' together a layout in a much shorter amount of time and then override the default styles with your own. It's basically templating for you. Behind the scenes a preprocessing tool is actually taking the default templates you write plus any of your customized overrides and converting the all of that code into one uniform stylized language.

3. The most useful mixin I've used this week was probably one for a button. Not only can it include the size, color, background-color, overall style, text overriding, etc, but it can also include hover effects. It can save a lot of rewriting for such a small thing that is used a lot in webpages and applications. The mixins in general are great for making standardization easier.
