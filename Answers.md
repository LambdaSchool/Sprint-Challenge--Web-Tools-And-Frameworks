1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
    I would introduce them to the process behind it using codepen similar to what we did earlier in the week. After typing out some code in CSS with LESS toggled on I would toggle it off and show them how it alters it. It's a clear way of showing how it translates the nested structure we use in LESS to the regular CSS format for selecting an element.
