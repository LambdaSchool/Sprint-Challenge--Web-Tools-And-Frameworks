1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
  Preprocessing is processing data before it is processed. That is the literal definition of preprocessing.
  Preprocessing in this case refers to writing a more reader-friendly version of our CSS file in the form of
  a .less file and then compiling that file back into a true CSS file.

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?
   `sudo npm install -g less`

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
   I really liked the .box-shadow() mixin from the Preprocessing-II assignment. I still have a lot more to
   learn about mixins.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?
   The 5 breakpoints in bootstrap are min-width (mobile first): extra small, small, medium, large, and 
   extra large. `.col-, .col-sm-, .col-md-, .col-lg-, .col-xl-`

5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?
   `.d-flex` and other variants.
