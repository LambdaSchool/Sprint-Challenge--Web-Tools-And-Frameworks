1. I would describe preprocessing as using a program to write code in a more intuitive way that can then be compiled into a less intuitive format. Preprocessing also allows you to do things like create variables, use mixins, and use functions to achieve a certain result in a more efficient, easier to read way.

2. npm install -g less or sudo npm install -g less

3. Prior to learning bootstrap I found the mixins used to replace media queries useful.

4. xs, sm, md, lg, xl

5. d-flex
