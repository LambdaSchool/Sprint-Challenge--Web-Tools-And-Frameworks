1. I would describe preprocessors as almost dialects, or slangs to CSS. HTML and CSS are the base language, and things like LESS, SASS, and Bootstrap are each a dialect. Ultimately they all mean the same thing, and if you learned LESS you could mostly read SASS or vice versa; but typically dialects have shortcuts in the language in the form of slang words. This dialect specifc slang could be seen as the small differences in syntax between preprocessors. In example, both SASS and LESS use nesting, but Sass doesn't use brackets and has it's own way of structuring itself in comparison to LESS.
