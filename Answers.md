1. Preprocessing allows you to nest classes and use format of coding that would not work in CSS by itself, but later be compiled into readable code by CSS. Rather than writing out the whole thing, as long as you are in the box (element) you want, you can nest in. Think as: if you already know the city, all you need to to is nest in and refer it to by the street name only.

2. npm install less

3. Parametric mixins; writing out a class with a value attached to it is much simpler than writing out everything. especially for cross-browser compatibility. 

4. xs, sm, md, lg, xl

5. class="d-flex"
