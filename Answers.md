# Sprint Challenge: Web Tools and Frameworks

## Self Study Questions:

1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
    *  Webpages are built using three basic languages: HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  HTML is the basic outline/structure of 'elements' in a web page, CSS determines the style, and Javascript deals with the more complex features that allow users to interact with content.  Preprocessing is basically the new and improved way to compose great CSS (styling) documents in a way that is more user friendly.  Preprocessing languages like less and sass allow web developers to write code in a way that easy to understand and more efficient to write for human beings, while will later be 'compiled' into CSS - the language required by the computer to apply styles to HTML.  

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?
    *  npm install less

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
    *  Hard to say after being exposed to Bootstrap 4, but perhaps opacity as it is very useful for hovers, although I later found out that you can also just divide the color by 1.5.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?
    * xs sm md lg xl

5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?
    * d-flex
