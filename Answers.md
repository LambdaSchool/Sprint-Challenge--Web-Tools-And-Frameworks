1. CSS is great a little bit primitive and incomplete. But ultimately great. Preprocessors allow you to use features that are normally in object oriented programming languages such as Java, JavaScript, Python C, etc. and implement them into your CSS. With this you are able to create placeholders known as variables that can store data to reuse in your code. If you want all paragraphs for instance to have a certain color you can create a varialbe let's say @p and have it equal the color. @p: teal; Now when you want to call upon said color for your paragraphs you would place the @p within the code. p { color: @p;}. Done. But let's say you are told that the design team no longer wants to use teal for that any more. Instead of going all through your code and changing the individual color from teal to say purple you find your variable @p: teal; and change it to purple. @p: purple;. Done. Your whole site just updated the text for that variable to purple from teal.
