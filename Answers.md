1: I'm going to assume that if this friend is curious about preprocessing,
they already know a little about code. That said, I would explain that
preprocessing is an extension to CSS which makes it faster and more 
managible. In several ways, LESS, a preprocessor, is giving high level
coding characteristics to CSS. With it, yuo may take advantage of things 
like scope, varibles, callbacks and functions.
