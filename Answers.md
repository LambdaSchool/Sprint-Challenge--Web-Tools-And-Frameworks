1. The way I would teach the basic idea behind preprocesing to a friend is to explain it like money. In order to use money in the us it must be in United States Dollars the same way a compiler only understand a certain type of language. So if someone from Japan has Yen and someone from spain has Euro when they come to the us they cannot use their money with our us purchasing systems. The money from the other countries has to go through the preprocessing system that is a currency exchange in order to get the right output. This output is then used as a proper input for the us purchasing system. Example= Yen, Euro --> Currency Exchange --> USD used with USD purchasing system
