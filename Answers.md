1. I would tell my friend about css files first, if I wanted to explain css pre-processors. I would go over how css affects the styling of the html page. I would then teach them the syntax of css, and have them become accustomed to writing css. Then, I would say, what if we could write CSS in the way that less allows us, without telling them about less. This would be a hypothetical, just to show them how convenient something like less would be. Then I would explain to them that this is possible with less. However, I'd explain that less isn't exactly css, because css still has its built-in rules that don't allow less to be written in a css file. I'd explain that we can, however, convert less code into css code by using a pre-processor. The pre-processor is basically like a language translator that translates from less to css, in this case.

2. The npm command to globally install less is npm install -g less.

3. The most useful mixin I've used this week is probably opacity, because it really made my project look good.

4. The breakpoints used in bootstrap are xs, sm, md, lg, and xl.

5. The utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox is d-flex.
