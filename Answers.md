How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
ans: Css preprocessing is a scripting language which offers new features and extends the traditional CSS.
we use some compiler to generate the css instead of directly writing CSS, and we can use nesting, variables, mixins, functions and we can generate the main CSS file from multiple files which deals with separate sections of a page, in other words, we can work in a modular approach and this makes work in a large project with many developer work together very simple and less merge conflict.
