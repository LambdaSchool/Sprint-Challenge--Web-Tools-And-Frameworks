**1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.**

Preprocessing extends CSS to allow added functionality such as: variables, mixins, selector nesting, etc. A precompiler (such as LESS) then converts the highler level abstraction back to vanilla CSS.

**2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?**

`npm install -g less`

**3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?**

Parameteric mixins used to create boxes on the fly are kinda useful

**4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?**

col, col-sm, col-md, col-lg, col-xl

**5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?**

`d-flex`
