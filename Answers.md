1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

CSS can sometimes become tedious and labor-intensive. It may take you long hours, if not days, to style one website. In order to make your job faster and more efficient, you need to do preprocessing. So "preprocessing" is basically the act of making CSS coding more efficient. You do that by using preprocessors. There are many kinds of preprocessors, but the one we're using for Lambda is LESS, which stands for Leaner Style Sheets. The syntax for LESS is similar to CSS but with minor differences. When you code using LESS, the changes you've made will automatically be compiled to CSS through a compiler. In other words, LESS is an example of a web tool that helps you do CSS job more quickly and effectively.

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?

.box-shadow and .skew are the most interesting and useful mixins I've used this week. .box-shadow enabled me to quickly add shadow effects to my buttons and .skew helped me style my texts in different degrees. Mixins are great in that they help you style your website (or HTML elements) faster because with them you can combine multiple classes into one class.
