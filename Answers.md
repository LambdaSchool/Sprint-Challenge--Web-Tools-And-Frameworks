* This is tricky, but I would first teach them some basic CSS, and then when they have a grasp of how CSS works. I would then introduce them to LESS, and show them nesting. And give them an example using the CSS code they have written, and show them a side by side display of less and CSS. For me, this has worked marvelously and I had no problem understanding it moving forward. Using functions and mixins, etc would be a bit tricky, but would be easy to tell them by giving them a ```border-radius``` function and have them input  parameters. There is one more thing to show them, but I forgot what is called, and have hardly used it. So I can't teach them that hahaha.
