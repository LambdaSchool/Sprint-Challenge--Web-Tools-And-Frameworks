1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

1a) Preprocessing allows the data we input to be converted into a friendly format for another language that streamlines the process. For CSS specifically, we have SASS, LESS and Stylus with each performing the same overarching goal in a pretty similar way but with their own specific data inputs. SASS uses $dollar-signs while LESS uses @strudel-signs and Stylus throws aside the contemporary formats of the other two and uses little to no symbols. Without these preprocessors, CSS is pretty limiting. With them, you can perform arithmetic operations, mixins, establish and call variables, functions, if/else statements, and more, effectively adding logic to the cascading style sheets language, CSS.

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?

2a) npm install -g less

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?

3a) This is a tough question. They're all useful, but for me personally I would have to say the box-shadow one. It allowed for cross-browser compatibility and allowed me to learn what @string meant when passed as a paramater and also taught me what the input for box-shadow in CSS is. Plus, box-shadow looks sweet!

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?

4a) xs, sm, md, lg, xl

5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?

5a) .d-flex and .d-inline-flex
