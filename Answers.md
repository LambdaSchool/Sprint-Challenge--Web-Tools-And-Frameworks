1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
   - Preprocessing is a concept that starts on your local computer. You start by downloading a popular preprocessing framework, like LESS or SASS for CSS. Then, you write a file following the syntax of the framework you have chosen. When you are done working on that file, the framework compiles (or interprets) the file you wrote into the standardized language. In this example, that language would be CSS. So the flow looks like: you write a LESS file, your local computer compiles that LESS file into a CSS fileâ€”which is what is served on the web. The advantages include faster development and easier syntax and readability for different developers.
2. What is the yarn command to globally install LESS?

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?
   - The button mixin was very useful, because you can make buttons right on the spot to whatever dimensions.
