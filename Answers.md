How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
Preprocessing is a shortcut that allows variables, mixins and nesting.  
Rather than writing out each task individually:
1-do this
2-do that
3-do this other thing
    and if ... 
        4-do this instead

You can say:
1-do this, do that, do this other thing
    and if... do this instead        

Instead of it being 4 individual steps, it is all written as one step.
