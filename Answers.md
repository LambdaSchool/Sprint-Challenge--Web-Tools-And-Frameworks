1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

I would tell him that writing vanilla CSS sucks and that he should use a language like Sass or LESS or Compass which give him a bunch of syntactic sugar to make writing CSS easier. That includes things like nesting selectors, variables, and more complex topics like functions and mixins.

2. What is the npm command to globally install LESS?

`npm i -g less`

3. What is the most useful mixin you have used this week?

I declared `.font-body` and `.font-headline` mixins that were really helpful.

4. What are the names of the 5 breakpoints used in bootstrap?

T-shirt sizes: xs, sm, md, lg, xl

5. What is the utility class name that turns an element into a flexbox?

`d-flex`
