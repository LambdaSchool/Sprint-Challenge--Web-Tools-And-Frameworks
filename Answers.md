1. I would steal josh knell's drawing and show a side by side comparison of how less code looks and how the similiar code would look post-compilation for css. I would then explain that pre-processing is just writing css in an html style (nesting) which is then compiled before the website is loaded so that everything in your .less file is then made into a single .css file.

2. npm install -g less    -g is the global

3. I liked the button mixin so that styling buttons were easy to apply

4. col- col-sm col-md col-lg col-xl   col- is default for xs

5. d-flex is used to display: flex;
