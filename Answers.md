1. Preprocessing is a tool that adds a layer of functionality to vanilla CSS, which has no inherent programming logic. It is a language that allows for the use of variables, grouped stylings, and functions. Essentially there is a compiler that parses out the preprocessing language (in our case, LESS) and generates the corresponding CSS file. We use a watch script to automatically update our index.css file whenever we change the index.less file. Preprocessing allows us to maintain a consistent style on more complicated sites, by using variables and grouped styles. 

2. npm install -g less

3. I like the mixins that allow easy color changes. Opacity was very useful for creating transparent background behind text that is over an image. 
4. xs, sm, md, lg, xl
5. d-flex
