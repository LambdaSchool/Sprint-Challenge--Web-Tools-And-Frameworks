1. CSS is a way to style html elements, however it can be kind tedious to work with on bigger,
   more complicated projects. Less let's us write the code in a different, more maneagable way,
   it also gives us a few shortcuts. After we write in less, we use a compiler which turns it
   into css, as if we were writing in css the whole time.

2. npm install -g less

3. .button-creator, a button mixin

4. col, sm, med, lg, xl

5. .d-flex
