1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

  Preprocessing in this case refers to writing a more reader-friendly version of our CSS file in the form of
  a .less file and then compiling that file back into a true CSS file.
