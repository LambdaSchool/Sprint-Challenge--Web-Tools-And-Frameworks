    1)How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

A preprocessor is a tool web developers use to write CSS code faster and more accurately.  Preprocessors allow developers to use several useful tools they wouldn't have if they were just using CSS.  These include variables, mixins, functions and scoping.  You can use these in a separate file from your CSS and the preprocessor will convert your preprocessor code into CSS code, saving you time and head aches.
