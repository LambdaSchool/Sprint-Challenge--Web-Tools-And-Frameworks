1) How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?
Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

In a way LESS (or preprocessing in general) is like using HTML, CSS, JavaScript or other languages to build/create some website or piece of software. However, with preprocessing you are using a 'language' to write more CSS more quickly. After writing the preprocessing it is passed into another program (called a compiler) and behind the scenes the compiler turns the preprocessing into CSS.
