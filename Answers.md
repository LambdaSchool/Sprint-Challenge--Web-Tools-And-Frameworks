1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend? Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.

Preprocessers are framework, like LESS or SASS for CSS. Using syntax from your choosen Preprocesser you write a file on your computer. The framework then compiles(fancy word for changes or processes) the file you wrote into a standardized language. What we are using in class is LESS and it compiles into CSS. The advantages of using a preprocesser are faster development, easier syntax, and readability for different developers.
