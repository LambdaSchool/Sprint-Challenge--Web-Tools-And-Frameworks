1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
I have actually had to recently do this. I explained it as like a madlibs generator. I put in the info it needs to compile a document that makes sense to another processor. (in mad libs, we fill out a form and it generates a document that makes a funny story for another reader) Another way of putting it is like a translator. I only "know" how to speak "easy" language. This translator is taking my easy language and converting it to a "super smart" language.
