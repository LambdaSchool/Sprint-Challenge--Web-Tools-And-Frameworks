Preprocessing is like a band. You hear (see) the final product (song), but there are many parts (instruments) mixed together in the background. You hear chords (different notes, played at the same time). Rather than the notes being played individually, and it taking more time to complete the song. Preprocessing is a more intuitive and efficient way to write a lot of code.
npm install -g less (if you're not allowed, adding "sudo" before "npm" will allow you to install it)
The most useful mixin I have used all week was with buttons.
