## Self Study

1. LESS allows one to write CSS in a way that allows nesting, among other writing styles that can greatly increase productivity. ```less-watch-compiler``` allows changes to be ported from a LESS file to a CSS file on save.

2. Install LESS: ```npm install -g less```

3. I don't believe I've utilized them to much to declare a "most useful mixin," however I do remember being surprised by the ```.skew``` mixin in Preprocessing-II, when I first was introduced to mixins.

4. 5 Bootstrap Breakpoints: xs, sm, md, lg

5. The ```display``` utility class can apply flexbox attributes.
