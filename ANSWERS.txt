1. How would you teach the basic ideas behind preprocessing to a friend?  Please don't copy and paste an answer here, use your own thoughts.
		Using LESS as the preprocessor of choice currently( there are others such as SASS), but all take the same approach of modularizing the use of
		and creation of the "name.css" file

		1 Nested syntax, which more easily and visually mimics the HTML layout
		2 Ability to define variables, kinda like a function definition plug values into defined placeholders
		3 Ability to define mixins, collection of often used commands that can be referenced in via a single user defined "command" .e.g. ".center
		 which would run the commands 
		4 Mathematical functions.
		5 Operational functions (such as “lighten” and “darken”)
		6 Joining of multiple files, goes back to modular statement earlier, eg. you can have named files;
		that breakdown the HTML structure into self defined files e.g. "Header", "footer" and through the 
		LESS compiler add to and build the "name.css" defined in the Style section.
